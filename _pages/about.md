I’m a PhD student at The Ohio State University working on particle astrophysics, specifically neutrino astronomy, under the supervision of
Prof. Amy Connolly

.
I completed my undergraduate studies at Universidad de Colima, in Colima, Mexico; in 2015 under the supervision of Dr. Alfredo Aranda (Fefo). In the summers of 2013 and 2014 I had the great opportunity to spend two internships at the neutrino division at the Argonne National Laboratory, working under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Paley. My work consisted of simulating different designs of neutrino detectors, and evaluating their feasibility.

I’m interested in the simulation and data side of the Askaryan Radio Array experiment (ARA).

Apart from physics, my interests are dancing, photography and traveling.

Since July 1st 2021, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Yale's Wright Lab, in Prof. Maruyama's [group](https://maruyama-lab.yale.edu/group-members). I work for the [CUORE/CUPID](https://cuore.yale.edu/) experiments, which search for neutrinoless double beta decay.

I got my [PhD](https://ccapp.osu.edu/people/torresespinosa.1) from The Ohio State University. My field of study was experimental particle astrophysics, specifically neutrino astronomy, under the supervision of [Prof. Amy Connolly](https://physics.osu.edu/people/hill.1370). My PhD thesis focused on the simulation and data analysis of the [Askaryan Radio Array experiment (ARA)](https://ara.wipac.wisc.edu/home).

I completed my undergraduate studies at Universidad de Colima, in Colima, Mexico; in 2015 under the supervision of [Dr. Alfredo Aranda (Fefo)](https://www.dunescience.org/facesofdune/alfredo-fefo-aranda/). In the summers of 2013 and 2014 I had the great opportunity to spend two internships at the neutrino division at the Argonne National Laboratory, working under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Paley. My work consisted of simulating different designs of neutrino detectors, and evaluating their feasibility.

Apart from physics, my interests are cycling, [photography](https://oia.osu.edu/2019-international-photography-exhibition/pretzel-man) and climbing.
